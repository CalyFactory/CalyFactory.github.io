추천시스템이란?[1]에서 짚었듯이, matrix factorization과 Cosin Distance 벡터 값을 활용한 matrix 확장에 대해 알아보겠다.

먼저, Wikipedia에서의 [Matrix factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization)이다.

Non-negative matrix factorization

> Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF or NNMF), also non-negative matrix approximation is a group of algorithms in multivariate analysis and linear algebra where a matrix V is factorized into (usually) two matrices W and H, with the property that all three matrices have no negative elements.
